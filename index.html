All across the country there are similar knots of women reversing others’ handiwork, seam ripping and taking off lace, unstringing beads one by one by hand in their spare time. These women are always looking for more women, particularly ones who can’t sew, to help take the garments apart. Recently they were bequeathed a gown with an exceptionally long train. Every inch covered in lace appliqué. They say it takes a very long time for a seamstress to undo a dress, to carefully remove every thread.

After all, a worn-once dress is hardly economical. A single lavish 19th-century silk wedding dress shifted tradition from thrift to splendor, from re-wearable colors to what would become the ridiculous western tradition of lacey and virginal white. Though Queen Victoria’s white was practical and patriotic: supporting artisanal over industrial. Her royal 18-foot train and abundant orange-blossom appliques—invitations for future fertility—were said to single-handedly revive Honiton lacemaking. My grandmother on the other hand wore a smart, two-piece gray suiting dress. As a seamstress, a dress she likely sewed herself.</span></div>

In 1983,in preparation for his plan to vanish the Statue of Liberty in front of a live audience, David Copperfield first practiced with something more readily accessible. He invited famous magicians from all over the world to come to a parking lot in LA and watch him disappear  a full moon from the night sky. Afterward he asked everyone to give notes for fine-tuning—you know what they say: if you can fool a knot of magicians you can fool anyone. I have to assume the moon trial was successful because a few months later as helicopters buzzed in the starlessness around her head, Copperfield raised an enormous diaphanous fabric in front of the iconic statue—mesmerizing both a live and home audience into believing the lady would vanish right before their eyes. And she does—the fabric falls, the audience is looking out at nothing.</span></div>

But there’s a hidden intimacy in space travel—in spite of NASA’s attempts to find a suitable military engineering solution, astronauts were outfitted by the seamstresses sewing undergarments that famously shaped the female figure of the ‘40s. Borrowed from stitching bras and diaper covers, from latex-dipping girdles at Playtex—to fabricate a suit that allowed a body to endure a lack of breathable air, to be willingly sent off through the atmosphere. These seamstresses learned to enact accuracy befitting otherworldliness without the use of a single straight pin for tacking and exactness. An infinitesimal needle puncture the only difference between—     and— . </br> And no earthly rehearsal before their trick was performed live by astronauts before a national audience. The interior of their spacesuits touching the exterior of the body. The exterior of their spacesuits touching airlessness. A body kept safe in the vastness of space through couture handiwork—a collective of women rendering the moon possible with precision stitching.</div>

It didn’t seem to matter that NASA scientists knew the intense unlikelihood of lunar life.

A room that has been celebrated and criticized for looking like no one’s childhood room ever. Though this is apparently untrue. The great green room was inspired by details of Brown’s own childhood nursery. Right down to the decorated tiles around the fireplace. It should be no surprise to find it was the future author of <i>Goodnight Moon</i> who suggested some adult authors might write splendid children’s books and solicited her favorite. Or to learn that her favorite was none other than the inimitable Stein. <i>Goodnight Moon</i>’s staccato repetition and rhymes deconstruct the lavish modernist-ness of the Steinian line into lullaby—stripped down to a child’s wild and simple declarations, preserving the fabric of syntactical play while letting each individual sound really sing rather than be saturated by proximity to so many other Steinian syllables. <i>Goodnight stars&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goodnight air&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goodnight noises everywhere.</i> Brown’s uncanny ability to capture children’s worlds using a child’s perspective of words.</span></div>

Along with her reason for such dazzling fabric. But a historical artifact cannot be taken apart at the seams in order to make a pattern for twinning.

The language of reproducing a dress without a pattern + the language of the writer at work:<i>drafted, corrected, proofed</i>. The hardest part—finding enough antique embroidered trims for two.
